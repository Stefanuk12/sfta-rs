I've decided to recreate this within Rust as the only open sourced versions are within PureBasic and PowerShell which are difficult to read.
I hope by doing this, it makes it easier to port to other languages as well.

Note: I have no idea what the code is doing, I simply rewrote [everything](https://github.com/DanysysTeam/PS-SFTA).
